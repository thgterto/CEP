## 2026-05-19 - Avoiding Committing Binary Artifacts During Refactoring
**Learning:** When running frontend verification scripts (like Playwright with `page.screenshot()`), large binary artifacts (e.g., `verification.png`) can be generated and accidentally staged or committed, cluttering version control.
**Action:** Always perform a workspace cleanup and check `git status` to ensure generated scratchpad scripts, logs, and binary files are explicitly removed before staging changes and submitting.
## 2026-05-19 - Safe Refactoring in EWMA
**Learning:** In Node.js v22, avoiding `Array.prototype.shift()` (an O(N) operation) and utilizing pre-allocated arrays along with hoisted loop-invariant math operations (like `1 - lambda`) inside hot statistical loops yields over 2x speedup on large datasets.
**Action:** When optimizing loop-heavy array manipulations in statistical algorithms (e.g. SPC), prioritize static allocation and scalar state-tracking (e.g., `prevZ`) over dynamic structural mutations (`push`, `shift`), while preserving native functions like `Math.pow` inside the loop to avoid floating point drift.
## 2026-05-19 - Redundant Array Iteration in computeCapability
**Learning:** In statistical calculation flows, some aggregate functions inherently calculate prerequisites (like `SPC.stdDev` calculating the mean internally). Failing to pass already computed values (e.g., passing the pre-calculated `mu` into `SPC.stdDev`) leads to redundant O(N) array traversals which impacts performance.
**Action:** When calling aggregate statistical functions, always check if they accept pre-calculated prerequisites (like the mean) as arguments to avoid duplicate work.
